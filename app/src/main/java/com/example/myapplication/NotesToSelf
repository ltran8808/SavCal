Having troubles with accessing state with variable appUIState in AppScreen>AppLayout
Read section Pass the data in ViewModel and State in Compose Lesson for clues

To Pass data, pass the ViewModel instance to the Screen class.

Re-read ExposedDropdownMenu on this page https://alexzh.com/jetpack-compose-dropdownmenu/
Re-read state hoisting to decide where to update timewindow value

Tested and found that Submit button isn't working
Potentially, the onSubmitButtonClick method isn't running.
The method might have to take input data from AppScreen. However, that doesnt sound true.
Because ViewModel should handle actions.


**2. `Function2<Double, Int, Unit>` (The "Expected" Type)**

*   **`Function2`**: This is a function that takes **two** arguments.
*   **`<Double, Int, Unit>`**: This describes the parameters and the return type. The first two (`Double`, `Int`) are the types of the arguments the function must accept. The last one (`Unit`) is the return type.

So, `Function2<Double, Int, Unit>` is a function that must be called with a `Double` value and an `Int` value as its arguments, and it returns nothing.

**In lambda syntax, this looks like:**


*   **Actual:** The lambda `{ println(...) }` takes zero parameters. Its type is `Function0<Unit>`.
*   **Expected:** The `onRetry` parameter requires a lambda that takes a `Double` and an `Int`. Its type is `(Double, Int) -> Unit`, which is the same as `Function2<Double, Int, Unit>`.

The compiler sees this mismatch and gives you the error: "actual type is 'Function0<Unit>', but 'Function2<Double, Int, Unit>' was expected."

#### The Correct Code

To fix it, you must provide a lambda that matches the expected signature. You must declare the two parameters.

**Fix 1: Use the parameters**
